AI Driven Development #60day challenge
Prompt for your AI assistant:
I want to build a calculator function that can add two numbers.
Create a failing test using Jest that:
- Tests adding 2 + 3 = 5
- Tests adding negative numbers
- Tests adding decimal numbers
- Uses clear, descriptive test names

Step 2: GREEN - Make It Pass
Prompt for AI:
Create the simplest add function that will make these tests pass.
Don't over-engineer it, just make it work.
